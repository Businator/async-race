# Async Race

## Run project

**start project**: `npm run start`

**port**: `1812`

**local address**: http://localhost:1812/

## Requirement

- each branch should call from a task, example: `feat-ppwf-1-implementation-of-filters`
- use one of the next flugs: `init: `, `feat: `, `fix: `, `refactor: `, `doc: ` for each commit:
- before adding commit you need run the command: `npm run lint:scripts:fix` and fix issues, if lint show 'em
- before create pull request you need to check build of our project: run the command `npm run build`. This command check our ts code and build project, if code hasn't mistakes and bump version, using [doc](https://semver.org/)
